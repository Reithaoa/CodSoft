## This project includes four main tasks, each with a different functionality implemented in Java. Below is a simple description of each task and how to run the programs.

## Task 1: Number Game

### Description
This is a fun number guessing game where you try to guess a randomly chosen number. The game tells you if your guess is correct, too high, or too low. You can play multiple rounds, and the game keeps track of your score.

### Features
- Random number generation (1 to 100).
- User input for guessing.
- Feedback on guesses (correct, too high, too low).
- Limited number of attempts.
- Option for multiple rounds.
- Score display based on attempts or rounds won.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `number_game` directory.
3. Compile the Java files using:
   ```bash
   javac NumberGame.java
   ```
4. Run the game using:
   ```bash
   java NumberGame
   ```

## Task 2: Student Grade Calculator

### Description
This program calculates the total marks, average percentage, and grade based on marks obtained in different subjects.

### Features
- Input marks for each subject.
- Calculate total marks.
- Calculate average percentage.
- Assign a grade based on the average percentage.
- Display total marks, average percentage, and grade.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `grade_calculator` directory.
3. Compile the Java files using:
   ```bash
   javac GradeCalculator.java
   ```
4. Run the program using:
   ```bash
   java GradeCalculator
   ```

## Task 4: Currency Converter

### Description
This application converts an amount from one currency to another using real-time exchange rates.

### Features
- Select base and target currencies.
- Fetch real-time exchange rates from an API.
- Input amount to convert.
- Convert the amount using the exchange rate.
- Display the converted amount and currency symbol.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `currency_converter` directory.
3. Compile the Java files using:
   ```bash
   javac CurrencyConverter.java
   ```
4. Run the program using:
   ```bash
   java CurrencyConverter
   ```

## Task 5: Student Management System

### Description
This system manages student data, allowing you to add, remove, search, and display students. It can also read from and write to a file.

### Features
- Class for student attributes (name, roll number, grade).
- Methods to add, remove, search, and display students.
- User interface for interaction (console-based or GUI).
- Read and write student data to a file.
- Input validation to ensure correct information.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `student_management_system` directory.
3. Compile the Java files using:
   ```bash
   javac Student.java StudentManagementSystem.java
   ```
4. Run the program using:
   ```bash
   java StudentManagementSystem
   ```

## General Instructions
1. Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Reithaoa/CodSoft.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the directory of the task you want to run.
4. Compile the Java files using:
   ```bash
   javac <Java_files>.java
   ```
5. Run the compiled Java program using:
   ```bash
   java <MainClass>
   ```

## Dependencies
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- For the currency converter, internet access is needed to fetch exchange rates.
